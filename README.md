# Web Traffic Forecasting using LSTM & GRU

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **Web Traffic Forecasting** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** deep learning models. The goal is to accurately predict future web traffic trends based on historical data, achieving an impressive **98% accuracy**.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Preprocessed time-series data** for web traffic
- 🔍 **LSTM and GRU models** for sequential forecasting
- 🎯 **Achieved 98% accuracy** in predictions
- 📉 **Visualization of predictions vs actual traffic**
- ⚡ **Scalable and adaptable for real-world applications**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras** (Deep Learning Framework)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Preprocessing & Evaluation)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of historical web traffic data, including:
- **Timestamp-based traffic records**
- **User visit trends** over time
- **Seasonal and cyclic patterns**

## 📌 Model Architecture
The project implements two deep learning architectures:
### 🔹 LSTM Model
- Multi-layer LSTM network for sequential prediction
- Handles long-term dependencies in web traffic trends

### 🔹 GRU Model
- Optimized variant of LSTM with fewer parameters
- Suitable for faster training and deployment

## 🎯 Performance
| Model | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|
| LSTM  | 98.1% |
| GRU   | 97.8% |

## 📊 Results & Visualization
The model predictions are compared against actual web traffic data to assess forecasting accuracy.
